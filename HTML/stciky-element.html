          We’ll have a div container that will be a flex container and then 4
          additional div elements that will be the flex items. Note we don’t
          have to use flexbox at all for position: sticky to work, here it’s
          just that flexbox happens to work great for our example.

          The California Pacific International Exposition half dollar is a
          fifty-cent piece that was struck by the United States Bureau of the
          Mint in 1935 and 1936 as a commemorative coin. Its obverse depicts
          Minerva and other elements of the Seal of California; the reverse
          shows buildings from the California Pacific International Exposition
          (held 1935–1936), which the coin was issued to honor. Legislation for
          the half dollar moved through Congress without opposition in early
          1935, and Robert I. Aitken was hired to design it. The San Francisco
          Mint produced 250,000 coins, but expected sales did not materialize.
          The Exposition Commission, left with over 180,000 pieces they could
          not sell, sought and obtained legislation authorizing new coins.
          Although there was a spike in prices for many commemorative coins in
          1936, the Exposition Commission's new coins also sold poorly, and
          150,000 pieces were returned to the Mint.
